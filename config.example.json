A soft halo of warm light gently illuminates the artifact, enhancing its natural textures and true colors without overexposure. The scene evokes a luxury museum exhibition environment — calm, elegant, and refined. Ultra-realistic ceramic or stone texture, professional product-photography lighting, visible floor reflections, and a sense of spatial depth.",
